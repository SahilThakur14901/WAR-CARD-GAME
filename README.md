# WAR-CARD-GAME
A Python program which simulates a card game known as war.
WAR is a basic card game in which a shuffled deck is evenly split between 2 players. Both the players flip over one card from the top of their deck and whichever player has the higher value for the corresponding rank (K>Q>J>10>9...). In case the values are equal, both the players draw 5 more cards and compare them again. Even then if both cards are same, the players will keep drawing 5-5 cards until one of them loses and results in the other player taking away all the drawn cards.
This program makes use of basic OOP concepts, and does not apply inheritance or polymorphism.
